#  Nib  #

A Swift implementation of various XML specifications.
Intended for use with RDF tools and libraries, but conceivably could be utilized elsewhere.

| Swift version | Package version |

| 5.3 | 0.1 |

##  Should I Use This Library?  ##

*Ideally,* **you should not.**
Nib is built as a highly precise/exact implementation of the algorithms present in the specifications it implements, which makes it more of a reference implementation than an optimized library for general usage.
*However,* there is something of a paucity of highly‚Äêoptimized native Swift implementations for the sorts of things that Nib accomplishes, so **you may find that it is the best, most‚Äêreliable tool for the job nonetheless.**

Nib takes advantage of the flexibility of the Swift language to implement a number of DSLs for expressing common data structures or operations.
If you are going to be scared off by something like `.EmptyElemTag‚Ä≤ | [.STag‚Ä≤, .content‚Ä≤, .ETag‚Ä≤]` then you might want to pick a different library.

**Nib requires an editor which supports Unicode and a programmer willing to input Unicode characters.**

##  Supports  ##

| Technology | Version(s) | Notes |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| XML EBNF | [1.1 (2nd ed.)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/#sec-notation) | Requires transcription into a DSL. Greedy matching only. Uses the XML 1.1 definition of `Char` when matching bracketed expressions. Does not support validity constraints. |

##  Dependencies  ##

Nib requires Swift ‚â•‚ÄØ5.3.
Future versions of Nib will likely require Foundation.
[`swift-corelibs-foundation`](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation) should provide sufficient compatibility for non-Apple platforms.

#  Contributing

XSD hasn't been updated since 05 April 2012, so my hope is to just build a package that works well and have that be that.
Consequently, the need/utility of external contributions (apart from bugfixes) should be slight.

(Naturally, although XSD isn't likely to change, the Swift Programming Language probably will.
So there will be the usual tasks of keeping everything up-to-date with the latest Swift version as well.)

If you do know of a bug, feel free to submit an issue.
If you have a fix, pull requests are open.
